Welcome to my **STM32 Practical Projects Repository**.
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with **STM32** microcontrollers.
The purpose of this repo is to progress from **microcontroller fundamentals** and **Bare-Metal** concepts to **advanced peripheral control** and **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**.

This repository will continue to grow as new projects, tutorials, and deep-dives are added.

---

##  Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of structured mini-projects and practical examples, covering:

* STM32 architecture and memory mapping
* Low-Level (LL) and Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) programming
* Mastering essential Peripherals (GPIO, Timers, UART, ADC)
* Working with interrupts (EXTI, NVIC) and DMA
* Implementing Real-Time Operating Systems (FreeRTOS)

Each project includes the necessary source code, configuration files (e.g., `.ioc`), and documentation to support learning and reproducibility.
